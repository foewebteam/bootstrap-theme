# Faculty of Environment WordPress Bootstrap Theme (WIP)

This is a complete re-working of the standard Bootstrap theme for Faculty of Environment research sites developed in WordPress.

**No SEO plugin is required with this theme. It already supports Open Graph and Twitter Cards alongside the standard Google SEO stuff.**

### Installation

Download the zip and either upload to your website at `<your-url>/wp-admin/themes.php` or FTP into your server and upload the contents into the `wp-content/themes` folder.

### Now using Redux Framework

Redux Framework is built-in to the theme. To add new fields and sections, open the options directory and edit the config.php file.

Most standard settings for any new website (favicon, logo, colours, fonts etc) are available in the settings menu in the WordPress back-end. This should allow much more time working on the appearance of the website and save time on the initial setup.

### Features Include

- Upload Favicon and site logo
- Choose a standard meta description
- Choose font (including all google fonts), font colours and link colours
- Enable / disable website preloader
- Enable / disable background image or background colour (with many options)
- Enable / disable Bootstrap Carousel
- Lots of footer options including default copyright text, background and font colours, whether to display widgets and more
- Bootstrap layout options
- Insert Google Analytics
- Custom CSS support

## TO-DO

- [ ] Multiple page layouts in options (left menu, right menu etc).
- [ ] Better Featured image control through options.
- [ ] Bootstrap optimisations.
- [ ] Make better page layouts in general (very standard right now).
